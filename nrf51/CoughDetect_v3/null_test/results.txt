Nothing but pin configurations. Same result with a gpio interrupt set 
6 mA 

GPIO pin configurations plus simple_ble_init.
3 mA

Gpio pin config, simple_ble_init, adv_name_only
3 mA

gpio pin config, simple_ble_init, adv_name_only, 5s timer
3 mA (1.7 mA according to fluke)

Squall board: 4 uA...so it's the fram or the rtc. Maybe I need to init the rtc?
